**Bounds:**

* Maximum and minimum values of a number.
* Rounded numbers have a range of possible actual values.
* Upper bound: Add half the rounded unit to the given value.
* Lower bound: Subtract half the rounded unit from the given value.

**Finding Bounds in Questions:**

* Identify the rounded unit.
* For upper bound: Use upper bound ÷ lower bound.
* For lower bound: Use lower bound ÷ upper bound.

**Example:**

* 1300 sheets of paper, rounded to the nearest 100 sheets.
* Upper bound: 165mm (height) ÷ 1250 (sheets) = 0.132mm.

**Maximum and Minimum Values:**

* When calculations use rounded values, the answer may not be accurate.
* Maximum value: Add half the rounded unit to each value used in the calculation.
* Minimum value: Subtract half the rounded unit from each value used in the calculation.

**Example:**

* Area of 6.2m x 3.3m, rounded to the nearest 10cm.
* Maximum value: 20.9375m²
* Minimum value: 19.9875m²

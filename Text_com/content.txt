Simple explanation: The gradient is essentially another word for slope. The higher the gradient (slope) of a graph at a point, the steeper the line is at that point. A negative gradient means that the line slopes downwards.
To find the gradient of a straight-line graph, pick two points on the graph. The gradient of the line is:"Change in y-coordinate/change in x-coordinate"

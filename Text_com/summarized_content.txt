**Graphing Basics:**

* The Cartesian coordinate system uses x and y axes to divide the plane into quadrants.
* Each point is represented by an ordered pair (x, y): x is the horizontal coordinate, y is the vertical coordinate.
* The point (0, 0) is the origin, where the axes intersect.

**Graphing Equations:**

* A graph is a set of points that satisfy an equation.
* To graph an equation, plug in different x values and calculate the corresponding y values to plot points.
* For simple equations like lines or circles, there are specific methods for graphing.

**Intercepts:**

* An intercept is a point where a graph crosses an axis.
* x-intercepts are points where the graph crosses the x-axis (y = 0).
* y-intercepts are points where the graph crosses the y-axis (x = 0).
* To find intercepts, set y = 0 for x-intercepts and x = 0 for y-intercepts and solve for the other coordinate.

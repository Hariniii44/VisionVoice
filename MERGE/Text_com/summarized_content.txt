**Functions:**

* A function is a way to work with two sets of numbers that are related.
* It is represented as f(x), where x is the input and f(x) is the output.
* Example: f(x) = 3x - 6 means multiply the input by 3 and then subtract 6.

**Evaluating Functions:**

* Evaluate f(x) means find the output f(x) for a specific input x.
* Example: f(10) = 3(10) - 6 = 24.

**Function Operations:**

* **Composition:** gf(4) means apply function g to the output of function f.
* **Iteration:** fÂ²(2) means apply function f twice to the input 2.
* **Solving for x:** f(x) = g(x) means find the input x where the outputs of f(x) and g(x) are equal.

**Inverse Functions:**

* An inverse function reverses the original function.
* To find the inverse, swap x and y in the original function and solve for y.
* Example: The inverse of f(x) = 2x + 3 is f^-1(x) = (x - 3) / 2.
